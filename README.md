## 1. **E0V1E_53_Sharpe.py**

### **Overview:**
This strategy is designed to optimize the Sharpe ratio by using a combination of technical indicators such as RSI, CTI (Commodity Channel Index), and SMA (Simple Moving Average). It aims to enter trades when the market conditions are favorable and exit based on dynamic stop-loss and take-profit levels.

### **Key Features:**
- **Timeframe:** 5 minutes.
- **Indicators Used:** 
  - RSI (Relative Strength Index) for overbought/oversold conditions.
  - CTI (Commodity Channel Index) for trend strength.
  - SMA (Simple Moving Average) for trend confirmation.
- **Entry Conditions:** 
  - The strategy enters a trade when the RSI is below a certain threshold, the CTI is below a specific value, and the price is below the SMA.
- **Exit Conditions:** 
  - The strategy uses a custom exit logic based on the fast stochastic indicator and CCI (Commodity Channel Index) to determine when to exit a trade.
- **Dynamic Stop-Loss:** 
  - The strategy uses a trailing stop-loss to lock in profits as the trade moves in a favorable direction.

### **Purpose:**
The goal of this strategy is to maximize the Sharpe ratio by entering trades with a high probability of success and exiting them before significant losses occur. It is suitable for traders who want to balance risk and reward in a volatile market.
